# Torch and Torchvision are core dependencies for Ultralytics/YOLO.
# While ultralytics often installs them automatically, specifying them
# can prevent version conflicts, especially on systems with/without GPUs.
# Choose one of the following torch installations based on your hardware.

# For systems WITH an NVIDIA GPU (recommended for performance)
# --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# torch==2.1.0
# torchvision==0.16.0

# For systems WITHOUT a dedicated NVIDIA GPU (CPU only)

torchvision
